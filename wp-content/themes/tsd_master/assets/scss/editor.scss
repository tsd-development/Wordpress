 TinyMCE Styles

 Styles in this file are compiled to assets/css/editor.css and are automatically loaded into your WordPress admin's
 TinyMCE editor. You will generally want to use these styles in combination with customizations to \NV\Hooks\Editor.php,
 which allows you to easily add new style presets to the TinyMCE editor.
